        	<p>
        		I am a senior studying Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am exploring my research interests as an undergrad; currently I am interested in the intersection of computer science and medicine. Specifically, I am passionate about accessibility and assistive technology, as well as designing technology to help those  with chronic illnesses. I plan to pursue a PhD in HCI, preferably focusing on the aforementioned areas.
